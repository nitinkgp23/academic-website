I am a Software Developer at [Cohesity](https://www.cohesity.com/), working in the field of Distributed File Systems. I majored in Mathematics and Computing, from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India.\
\
During my internships at college, my interests typically lied in the field of Machine Learning. I worked on a project during my internship at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/) which deals with understanding the layout of structured images such as those of Restaurant Menus. My primary focus was on applying Machine Learning algorithms on structured data, such as graphs. I was being supervised by [Herve Dejean](https://europe.naverlabs.com/people_user/Herve-Dejean/) and [Ioan Calapodescu](https://europe.naverlabs.com/people_user/Ioan-Calapodescu/).\
\
I also worked at [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), supervised by [Dr. Russell Greiner](https://rgreiner6.wixsite.com/greiner), where I worked on building ML models for detecting Schizophrenia, from brain's 4D-fMRI scans.\
\
In addition to my interests in ML, I have also been a Google Summer of Code developer at [Sunpy](https://sunpy.org/), an open-source organisation dedicated to developing tools for Solar Physics. I was supervised by [Stuart Mumford](http://stuartmumford.uk/) where I worked on developing a better interface for JSOC Client, used to download astronomical data from JSOC servers. I have also been an active member at [Kharagpur Open Source Society](https://kossiitkgp.org/), a club at my university for promoting love and use of Open Source.\

In my free time, I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64258644-nitin-choudhary) and play.
